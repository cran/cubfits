The \pkg{cubfits} package mainly composes with three main functions
\begin{enumerate}
\item \code{cubfits()} fits models for sequences with observed $\phi$ values
      (expression levels) and measurement errors,
\item \code{cubappr()} approximates models for sequence without any observed
      $\phi$ values, and
\item \code{cubpred()} fits model for sequences with observed $\phi$ values
      and measurement errors, and then predicts $\phi$ values for sequences
      without observations.
\end{enumerate}
See package's help pages for details of other input options.\footnote{
\code{?cubfits::cubfits}, \code{?cubfits::cubappr}, and
\code{?cubfits::cubpred}.

\subsection[Demonstrations]{Demonstrations}
\label{sec:demonstrtions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\thesubsection. Demonstrations}

The \pkg{cubfits} provides quick examples for three main functions:
\begin{Code}
> demo(roc.train, 'cubfits')    # for cubfits()
> demo(roc.appr, 'cubfits')     # for cubappr()
> demo(roc.pred, 'cubfits')     # for cubpred()
\end{Code}
These \pkg{cubfits} demos perform short MCMC runs
and analyze toy datasets (\code{ex.train} and \code{ex.test}) for
Ribosome Overhead Cost (ROC) model~\citep{Shah2011}
which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:plotbin}. The toy datasets have only 100
short sequences and 3 amino acids are considered.

For a standard data analysis, the minimum process basically includes that
\begin{enumerate}
\item reading sequences and expressions files,
\item converting to appropriate data structures,
\item running a main function (MCMC),
\item summarizing MCMC outputs, and
\item plotting predictions.
\end{enumerate}
The \pkg{cubfits} also provides an example using simulated data:
\begin{Code}
> demo(simu.roc, 'cubfits')     # cubfits() is called.
\end{Code}
Note that this demo will generate a fake sequence file (\code{toy_roc.fasta})
in FASTA format at working directory, and
read it back (for testing). Also, it converts the data into correct format
needed by \code{cubfits()}, then runs MCMC and generates a plot.


\subsection[Generic Functions (Aside)]{Generic Functions (Aside)}
\label{sec:generic_functions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\thesubsection. Generic Functions (Aside)}

Note that the three main functions are wrappers of other generic functions that
perform parameter initializations, propose new parameters, compute
MCMC acceptance/rejection ratio, and more.
The function \code{init.function()} is to initial generic functions that
will be called by the three main functions.
Although \code{init.function()} is called within each of three main
functions to setup the generic functions, it also needs to be called before
using other utility functions, such as \code{fitMultinom()}, see
Section~\ref{sec:misc} for examples.

Companying with control variables such as \code{.CF.CT} and \code{.CF.OP},
the \code{init.function()} will dispatch the
corresponding generic functions into a default environment \code{.cubfitsEnv},
and other main functions may call those generic functions dynamically.

Note that generic functions in original \proglang{R} design only depend on
input object types rather than options.
However, this design of \pkg{cubfits} has several good purposes:
\begin{itemize}
\item functions are clearer by making well data structures and
      simplifying options,
\item extensions are easier by adding more genetic functions rather than
      changing main functions, and
\item performance is more efficient by avoiding extra
      conditional checks such as \code{if(...)\{...\} else\{...\}}
      in every iteration.
\end{itemize}
Also, the design can avoid tedious CRAN checks since there is some restrictions
of accessing \code{.GlobalEnv}.

For example, \code{.cubfitsEnv$my.fitMultinomAll()} is called in several
internal functions to fit multinomial logistic regression in every MCMC
iterations. In particular, it has four generic functions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \code{my.fitMultinomAll.lapply()} ueses \code{lapply()} in serial version,
\item \code{my.fitMultinomAll.mclapply()} uses \code{parallel::mclapply()}
      in multi-cores and shared memory machines,
\item \code{my.fitMultinomAll.task.pull()} uses \code{pbdMPI::task.pull()}
      in distributed clusters, and
\item \code{my.fitMultinomAll.pbdLapply()} uses \code{pbdMPI::pbdLapply()}
      in distributed clusters but only efficient for homogeneous tasks.
\end{enumerate}
Through \code{init.function()}, there is no need to check which generic
function should be called within MCMC step, and there is no need to worry
serial or parallel methods when designing a MCMC algorithm.
